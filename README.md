# Countdown

Countdown was my original passion project the was started before I ever had a
computer science class. This project was never finished but it taught me what
MVC is, how object-oriented programming works, and generally many smaller
things about how apps in my phone are built.
The idea for the app was very simple, you have a list of dates, and it tells
you how many days until or since those dates in a aesthetically pleasing list.
